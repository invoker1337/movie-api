    <h1>Movie API Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Title: Achievement 2 Project: myFlix</h2>
    <p>Objective: To build the server-side component of a "movies" web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movie. </p>


    <h2>Endpoints</h2>

<!-- The four "methods" of hhtp requests:
Post=create
get=read
put(/patch)=update
delete=delete -->
